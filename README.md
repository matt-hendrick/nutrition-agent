# Nutrition Assistant Demo

This is a demo web application that showcases a very simple LLM-based nutrition assistant. The assistant can answer nutrition-related questions, provide healthy restaurant and recipe suggestions, and cite sources. This was hacked together quickly and is not a production application. See a deployed version of this demo [here](https://frontend-production-3e5c.up.railway.app/).

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Backend: Python/FastAPI (OpenAI API, Tavily/BS4 web search tools)
